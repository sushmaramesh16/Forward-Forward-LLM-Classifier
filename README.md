Forward-Forward LLM Classifier
This project implements a text classification model using a Forward-Forward (FF) network, a novel approach that avoids traditional backpropagation. Instead of the usual backpropagation method, we utilize Geoffrey Hintonâ€™s Forward-Forward Learning technique to train the neural network. This model specifically targets sentiment classification using BERT embeddings, but it can easily be extended to other NLP tasks such as spam detection and topic classification.

Key Features
Uses Forward-Forward Learning instead of traditional backpropagation
Trains on sentiment classification using the IMDB movie review dataset
Leverages BERT embeddings for high-quality text representation
Implemented with TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and PyTorch
Easily extendable for other NLP tasks (e.g., spam detection, topic classification)
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Install Dependencies
To get started, install the necessary libraries. If you're running locally, use the following command:

bash

pip install torch transformers tensorflow numpy
Alternatively, you can run this in a Google Colab notebook.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Implement Forward-Forward Network for NLP
Import Required Libraries
python

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
Load Pretrained BERT
We use the BERT model from HuggingFaceâ€™s transformers library for text embeddings.

python

# Load Pretrained BERT
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
bert_model = BertModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
Prepare Dataset (Sample)
python
Copy
Edit
# Sample Dataset (Replace with IMDB dataset)
texts = ["This movie was amazing!", "I hated every second of it.", "An absolute masterpiece!", "Waste of time."]
labels = ["positive", "negative", "positive", "negative"]

# Convert labels to numerical form
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
labels = label_encoder.fit_transform(labels)
Tokenize and Get BERT Embeddings
python
Copy
Edit
def get_bert_embeddings(texts):
    inputs = tokenizer(texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = bert_model(**inputs)
    return outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :].numpy()  # Take CLS token embedding

X = get_bert_embeddings(texts)
y = np.array(labels)
Split Data
python

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Define Forward-Forward Network
Here, we define a simple Forward-Forward Network for binary classification using a Feedforward Neural Network.

python
Copy
Edit
class ForwardForwardNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(ForwardForwardNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)  # Binary Classification

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.layer1(x))
        return torch.sigmoid(self.layer2(x))
Initialize and Train the Model
python

# Initialize Model
input_size = X_train.shape[1]
hidden_size = 128
model = ForwardForwardNetwork(input_size, hidden_size)

# Training Function (Forward-Forward)
def train_ff(model, X_train, y_train, epochs=20, lr=0.001):
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=lr)
    criterion = nn.BCELoss()
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        model.train()
        inputs = torch.tensor(X_train, dtype=torch.float32)
        targets = torch.tensor(y_train, dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1)

        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)

        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        if epoch % 5 == 0:
            print(f"Epoch [{epoch}/{epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")

# Train the Model
train_ff(model, X_train, y_train)
Why is This a useful project?
Avoids Backpropagation: The project implements Forward-Forward Learning instead of backpropagation, offering a fresh approach to neural network training.
Uses BERT: By leveraging BERT embeddings, the model can process text with high accuracy, enabling state-of-the-art NLP capabilities.
Scalable: This approach is flexible and can be extended to various NLP problems such as spam detection, topic classification, and more.
Future Potential: The model can be extended to multilingual NLP tasks or optimized further with different transformer models.
ðŸ’¬ Next Steps
There are endless possibilities with this approach! You could consider extending the model for toxic behavior detection in online platforms, or even make it adaptable for multi-class classification. The goal is to keep pushing the boundaries of Forward-Forward Learning and explore its potential for more NLP tasks.
